Important Info about Express Router versions and errors
======

## How does EOL (End of Life) work for Express Router?
Express Router has normal releases and LTS (Long Term Support) releases. Read below for more information.

**Normal releases** - **End of Life timer is *180 DAYS, APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS***.

For normal releases, as soon as the next version of Express Router is released, the EOL (End of Life) timer for the previous version begins. For example, if version 1.1.1 is released, version 1.1 will begin its End of Life timer.

**LTS releases** - **End of Life timer is *TWO YEARS***.

For LTS releases, the timer works the same like normal releases, but LTS releases have longer timers/cycles. **Another difference with LTS cycles/timers is that instead of the timer starting when the NEXT build is released, the timer starts when the next *LTS* build is released.**


***PLEASE DO NOTE THAT THESE TIMERS ARE NOT USED ALL THE TIME, AS RELEASES WITH MAJOR BUGS OR VULNERABILITIES CAN BE GIVEN A SHORTER EOL TIMER, OR COULD BE IMMEDIATELY PRONOUNCED AS END-OF-LIFE.***
